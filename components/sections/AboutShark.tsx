            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              As a <strong className="text-cyan-400">disabled veteran</strong>, I've learned that the values that matter most in the military—<strong>integrity, reliability, and mission-focused execution</strong>—are the same values that matter in hosting. When your website goes down, you need someone who treats it like a mission, not just a ticket number.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              My service taught me that <strong className="text-teal-400">details matter</strong>. Whether it's securing a perimeter or securing your data, there's no room for "good enough." That's why Megaladon Hosting was built from the ground up with enterprise-grade security, 24/7 monitoring, and the kind of attention to detail that keeps your business running.

            </div>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              After my service, I earned my <strong className="text-cyan-400">IT degree specializing in Application Development</strong>. I didn't just learn theory—I built real systems, optimized databases, and deployed applications that needed to perform under pressure. I've coded everything from custom CMSs to automated deployment pipelines.

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              This technical foundation means when you call Megaladon Hosting support, you're not talking to someone reading from a script.

            <p>
              <strong className="text-cyan-400">It started with frustration.</strong> After leaving the service and diving into web development, I needed reliable hosting for my projects. What I found was disappointing: companies that promised "99.9% uptime" but went dark for hours, support teams that didn't understand basic server issues, and pricing schemes designed to nickel-and-dime you at every turn.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I thought, <em className="text-teal-300">"There has to be a better way."</em> So I built it. 🚀
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong className="text-cyan-400">Megaladon Hosting was born from a simple principle:</strong> Treat clients the way I wanted to be treated. That means <strong>transparent pricing</strong> (no hidden fees), <strong>real support</strong> (not offshore call centers), and <strong>infrastructure that actually works</strong> (NVMe storage, LiteSpeed servers, DDoS protection from day one).
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The name "Megaladon" isn't just about being big and powerful—though our infrastructure certainly is. 🦈 It's about being <strong className="text-teal-400">prehistoric reliable</strong>. Megaladon sharks ruled the oceans for millions of years because they were perfectly adapted to their environment. We've built our hosting the same way: optimized, battle-tested, and built to survive.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong className="text-cyan-400">Today, Megaladon Hosting serves everyone</strong> from solo developers launching their first portfolio site to small businesses running e-commerce empires. Every client gets the same level of service—because whether you're spending $3.99/month or $19.99/month, you deserve hosting that <strong>just works</strong>. ✅

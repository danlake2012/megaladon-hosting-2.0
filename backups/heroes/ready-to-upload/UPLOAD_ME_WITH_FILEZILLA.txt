Upload instructions — 'shark-hero-2' package

Files included:
- shark-hero-2.jpg
- shark-hero-2.webp

Where to upload (choose one or both depending on what you want to update):
1) Static homepage (main site)
   Remote path: /public_html/megaladonhosting/assets/images/

2) WHMCS theme (client area)
   Remote path: /public_html/billing/templates/megaladon/images/
   OR to the active theme's images folder if the active WHMCS theme is different.

FileZilla tips:
- Use Host: megaladonhosting.com  Username: danlake2012  Port: 21  (your FTP password)
- Protocol: FTP  Encryption: Start with "Require explicit FTP over TLS" — if fails use "Only use plain FTP (insecure)"
- Transfer Mode: Passive
- Drag the files from this local folder (ready-to-upload/shark-hero-2) into the remote path above.
- If FileZilla prompts for overwrite, select "Overwrite" to replace the file on the server.

Verify the upload after transfer:
1) Right-click the uploaded file on the server and Refresh
2) Confirm file size and timestamp match
3) Visit: https://your-domain.example/assets/images/shark-hero-2.jpg (replace with your domain) and expect HTTP 200 and the new image

If the homepage still shows the previous image, try:
- Hard refresh in browser (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R)
- Purge CDN cache if you use one (Cloudflare, etc.)
- Clear WHMCS Smarty cache: Admin → Utilities → System Cleanup → Empty Template Cache (if applicable)

If you'd like, I can upload these for you via CLI (scp/rsync) — provide server path and SSH access or I can guide you through a live FileZilla session.

Upload instructions — 'mega-hero' package

Files expected (you can upload one or both):
- mega-hero.jpg   (full-size JPEG for browsers that don't support webp)
- mega-hero.webp  (optimized webp for modern browsers)

Where to upload (choose one or both depending on where you want the hero):
1) Main public site (homepage)
   Remote path: /public_html/assets/images/

2) WHMCS client area theme
   Remote path: /public_html/billing/templates/megaladon/images/

FileZilla quick tips
- Host: megaladonhosting.com
- Username: danlake2012
- Port: 21 (or 22 for SFTP — use whichever you prefer when connecting)
- Protocol: FTP (port 21) or SFTP (port 22)
- Transfer Mode: Passive

After uploading
1) Verify the file shows in the server directory and matches size/timestamp
2) Visit the page and hard refresh (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R) or clear CDN cache
3) If you want me to verify and clear caches for you, say so and I can do that via the same connection.

Notes
- Because the repo now references "mega-hero.jpg" + "mega-hero.webp" in index.html / assets/css / assets/js, uploading these files under the paths above will make the homepage use them immediately (after cache clear).

If you'd like me to upload the file for you, either attach it here or give me SSH access and I will place it in the right location and verify.
